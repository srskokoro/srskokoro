// The following ensures that our convention plugins are always compiled with a
// consistent JVM bytecode target version. Otherwise, the compiled output would
// vary depending on the current JDK running Gradle. Now, we don't want to alter
// the JVM toolchain, since not only that it would download an entirely separate
// JDK, but it would also affect our dependencies, e.g., it would force a
// specific variant of our dependencies to be selected in order to conform to
// the current JDK (and it would otherwise throw if it can't do so). We want
// none of that hassle when we just want our target bytecode to be consistent.
// Additionally, not only that we want consistency, we also want the output's
// bytecode version to be as low as it can reasonably be, i.e., Java `1.8`, as
// Android Studio currently expects that, or it'll complain stuffs like "cannot
// inline bytecode built with JVM target <higher version>â€¦" etc., when the build
// isn't even complaining that.
